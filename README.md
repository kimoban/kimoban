## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**kimoban/kimoban** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an Airbnb Clone Project as a software developer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ProDev Front-End and Back-End with ALX.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, web development teams, and any innovative software that solves real-world problems.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mastering advanced backend concepts, deploying full-stack apps, and implementing secure APIs.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, RESTful APIs, and what itâ€™s like learning full-stack development with ALX.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me: {isaiahkimoban87@gmail.com}
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started learning to code to build my startup idea, and now Iâ€™m addicted to clean UI and optimized backend logic!
