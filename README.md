## 🚀 About Me

I’m a dedicated learner currently pursuing both **ALX ProDev Front-End** and **ProDev Back-End** tracks. My journey into software engineering began with a deep curiosity about how websites and digital experiences are built. I’m inspired by the power of code to bring ideas to life — crafting intuitive user interfaces on the front end and building resilient, secure systems on the back end.

💡 What excites me the most is **bridging design with functionality**, and turning complex technical problems into seamless, meaningful user experiences.

🌟 **My vision** is to build **impact-driven digital products** that empower communities, streamline daily life, and make technology accessible to everyone — especially in underrepresented regions.

⚡ Fun fact: I started learning to code to build my startup idea, and now I’m addicted to clean UI and optimized backend logic!

🛠️ I love working on:
- Scalable web applications (Django, Node.js, React)
- Backend APIs & database-driven services
- Interactive, responsive UIs
- Open-source contributions
- Projects that solve real-world problems
