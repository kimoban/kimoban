## Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Airbnb Clone Project as a software developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ProDev Front-End and Back-End with ALX.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, web development teams, and any innovative software that solves real-world problems.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with mastering advanced backend concepts, deploying full-stack apps, and implementing secure APIs.
- 💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, RESTful APIs, and what it’s like learning full-stack development with ALX.
- 📫 You can reach me: {isaiahkimoban87@gmail.com}
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started learning to code to build my startup idea, and now I’m addicted to clean UI and optimized backend logic!
